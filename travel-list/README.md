# Far Away — Travel List

A small, clean **React** app for planning trips: add items with quantities, mark them as packed, sort the list, clear it, and see progress at a glance.  
Built as a fundamentals exercise (state, props, lifting state up, derived data, conditional rendering) and deployed on **Vercel**.
